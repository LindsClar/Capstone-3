#Introduction

Coffee can make or break a morning. The roast and refreshing sip of a hot cup of coffee can set the tone for the rest of your day. 
This morning's cup inspired me to analyze some coffee data. I decided to use data from Kaggle on the sales of different coffee shops. 
From there, I would wrangle, explore, and predict sales for the coffee shop business. My goal was to wrangle the information of coffee shops 
so that I can optimize their menus to balance profitability, improve revenue, and meet customer demand. I will provide engaging visuals 
and analyze ways to expand the business. Now, we will go through the process of organizing, analyzing, and modeling a multivariate time-series 
DataFrame. This will assist with proposals to improve business and understand consistent sales patterns that the coffee shop has.
